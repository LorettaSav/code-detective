    <h3>About this project</h3>

        <h6>
            The Code Detective is a project built during CodeOp bootcamp under the extremely helpful guidance (technical and emotional) of Germinal Camps, Vicky Busch, Zoe Laventhol and Pia Prozesky. 
            Thank you for being able to handle me in my ups, my downs and my crazies!!
            This project was “baptised” by the special duck, Calix who I thank so ducking much!!
            Also, I can't miss giving a general appreciation and love to my whole class, with which we are going through this together with good humour, lots of wholesomeness and understanding and by having each other’s backs!!
            Yes, now I have finished my Oscars' speech, I DO feel satisfied and, if you are still reading, I thank you too 
